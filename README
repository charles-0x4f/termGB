TermGB: A terminal-based Nintendo GameBoy emulator written in ANSI C.


What is is: Currently, it doesn't do much, many of the extended instructions
are not implementented, and the graphics do not work yet, which is the current
major hurdle.


What it will be: An ncurses (or similar) based GameBoy emulator, with an
adequate level of accuracy.


A note about the source: This program has been written in a semi-tutorial
manner. This method was chosen as when I began looking into writing this
emulator I was relatively ignorant of all low level concepts of a computing
system. In essence, I learned about the inner workings of a computer along
with the advancement of this program. The tutorial style was as much for me
as it was for anyone else attemping to learn about it for the first time as
well.


I have no affiliation with Nintendo and I claim to hold no trademarks or such.
